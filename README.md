**`NOTICE:`** if you've found my software useful feel free to use it in any way you want

but please note I will not be able to offer anything in return; no support of any kind, not even prioritized features/bugfixes. I'm doing this just for fun, and don't want to make it a responsibility. And like the license says, you're still using it entirely on your own risk :-)
